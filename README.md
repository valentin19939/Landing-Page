# Base layout template with Gulp, SCSS and Stylelint
This is a landing page designed for product presentation. It showcases featured products with descriptions and prices but does not include direct purchasing functionality. The main goal is to attract potential customers, provide product information, and encourage engagement through contact options. While it is not a full e-commerce site, it could be expanded into one by adding a shopping cart, checkout system, and payment processing.

This Landing Page is built using:
✅ HTML5 + SCSS for structure and styling.
✅ JavaScript for interactive elements.
✅ Flexbox/Grid for efficient layout positioning.
✅ Git/GitHub for version control.
✅ Stylelint + BEMlint for code standardization.
